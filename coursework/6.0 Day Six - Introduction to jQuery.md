Today's class will cover the Document Object Model.

## Today's Learning Objectives

Today we'll cover these **learning objectives**. By the end of today, you'll be able to:

* *explain the terms 'DOM' and 'Node'*
* *explain how the Document Object Model maps to HTML*
* *explain how the Window object is connected to all JavaScript objects in an active web page*
* *select elements of a page*
* *edit the state of existing HTML elements*

As you attend the lecture and lab, read these notes, and work on your homework, keep these learning objectives top of mind. If you're having difficulty with any of the objectives, make sure to ask questions.

## The DOM

The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is a programming interface that gives you access to your HTML document and its elements. It's a structural representation that you can use to target and modify your HTML.

Think of it as a kind of tree. You have elements, which are inside of other elements, which are inside of more elements. Each group of nested elements forms a branch, each branch is comprised of one or more nodes, and each node is an object with properties you can manipulate.

When you open your HTML document, the rendering engine (e.g. Google Chrome) parses your document to build the tree, recognizes what each node is and creates an object that represents it. Taken altogether, this is the page you see in your browser.

## Selectors

Accessing the DOM via plain JavaScript is relatively simple. The following syntax, for example, uses a [CSS-style selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) to target all elements with the classname "my-class": `document.querySelectorAll('.my-class');`.

Any valid CSS selector will work. This means that if you could use that selector to style an element on your page, you could use an identical selector in JavaScript to "select" that exact same element:

**styles.css**
```
.introduction h2 {  
    /* this would affect all h2 elements found */
    /* inside elements with the class 'introduction' */
}
```
**main.js**
```
/* this would select all the same h2 elements */
document.querySelectorAll('.introduction h2')
```
We can use any combination of selectors available to us in CSS, including nested selectors and multiple elements. Here's an example of a complex selector:
```
document.querySelectorAll('#container ul.my-todo-list li input:checked, #options input:checked');
```
The previous selector would return a collection of elements containing only checked input fields from inside both a container with an ID of "options" AND list items inside a list with the class "my-todo-list" inside a container with an ID of "container". What a mouthful!

It's always best to simplify our selectors as much as possible, since every extra level of selection requires further processing. Instead of that big nasty selector above, it would be much better to give all the input fields we want to select a specific class, like so:
```
document.querySelectorAll('.my-input-fields:checked');
```
It's important to note that `document.querySelectorAll()` returns a NodeList. A NodeList is similar to an array but doesn't have some of the methods we expect on a plain old JavaScript array. We'll discuss a few different methods for dealing with these objects in the future, but for now, be aware that you may not be able to iterate over a NodeList in ways you might expect.

## Adding & Removing Elements

For your web page to feel dynamic, you'll often want to add and remove elements from the page. Luckily, JavaScript has built-in methods that do just that.

Let's look at a simple example:
```
/* creates an li text string */
const li = "<li>A dynamically generated list item!</li>";

/* parses the text string as HTML and appends it to a ul element that already exists in the HTML */
document.querySelector('ul').insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', li);
```
Here's an example that adds a list item just inside an unordered list, before its first child.
```
/* creates an li text string */
const li = "<li>The first list item!</li>";

/* parses the text string as HTML and prepends it to a ul element that already exists in the HTML */
document.querySelector('ul').insertAdjacentHTML('afterbegin', li);
```
To remove an element, use the `.remove()` method. This will permanently remove an element from the page, including all its event handlers and associated data.
```
/* removes the element with the id 'container' */
document.querySelector('#container').remove();
```
For more ways to add and remove elements, check out this [resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents) on manipulating the DOM.

## Modifying Elements

Now that we know how to add and remove elements from our web page, the next step is to learn how to modify existing elements.

### Attributes

It's often desirable to modify an element's attributes. The most common attribute we'll want to change is the `class`. JavaScript makes this easy with `classList.add()`, `classList.remove()`, and `classList.toggle()`. These do exactly what you'd expect from their names: add a new class, remove an unwanted class, or 'toggle' a class by adding it if it's not present or removing it if it is. Let's look at a simple example:
```
function flipSwitch() {
  document.querySelector('#lightbulb').classList.toggle('lit');
}
```
We aren't just limited to classes, though! JavaScript lets us modify any attribute we want with the `.setAttribute()` method.
```
let url = 'http://placekitten.com/200/300';
document.querySelector('.cat-image').setAttribute('src', url);
```
To get the current value of an attribute, use `getAttribute()`; to remove an attribute, call `removeAttribute()`.
