Today's class will cover the powerful CSS tool known as media queries.

## Today's Learning Objectives

Today we'll cover these **learning objectives**. By the end of today, you'll be able to:

* *explain the concept of media queries and give an example of why a media query should be applied to a styled element, e.g. resizing fonts for mobile and desktop cases*
* *write a min-width based media query that induces a state change for multiple screen sizes, e.g. resizing fonts for mobile and desktop cases*

As you attend the lecture and lab, read these notes, and work on your homework, keep these learning objectives top of mind. If you're having difficulty with any of the objectives, make sure to ask questions.

## What Are Media Queries?

Media queries are at the heart of responsive design, the technology enabling browsers to optimize the experience for the current viewport dimensions. Media queries define the *breakpoints* where a layout adjusts.

With breakpoints, a layout can adjust when a screen is smaller or larger than the original layout. Most designers and developers build the smallest layout first so they make sure they can accommodate the core content and functionality needed, even within tight screen constraints. We call this *mobile-first design*.

### How Media Queries Work

Media queries, like CSS selectors, query the current environment to see if a condition exists. If there is a match to a condition, a set of special CSS rules apply to the page.

The Mozilla Developer Network has this definition of Media Queries:

**<blockquote>A media query consists of a media type and at least one expression that limits the stylesheets' scope by using media features, such as width, height, and color.</blockquote>**

Media queries use the following format when in a stylesheet:
```
@media <type> and (<features>) {
  <css statements>
}
```
You may also use media queries within the HTML `<link>` element to load only stylesheets that apply to the given query:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" media="print and (max-width: 500px)" href="print.css">
```
#### EXAMPLE MOBILE-FIRST MEDIA QUERY

Notice how `@media` statements nest entire CSS statements within them:
```
/* applies to every device */
.container {
  width: 100%;
}

/* applies only to screens with a minimum width of 1024px */
@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {
  .container {
    width: 70%;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
}
```
### Media Types

Media queries can optionally begin with a media type. Media types specify what type of output device will apply the CSS rules. If no media type is specified, it is assumed that you intend to apply the rule to all output types. Here are the most broadly supported output types:

* `all` applies enclosed CSS rule statements to all devices, the default.
* `screen` applies rules only to devices with screens.
* `print` applies rules only when printed.

### Media Features

Media queries can also query features that match when a certain condition is true. For example, you can query to see if the viewport is a certain width, or if the viewport is in fullscreen mode, or has a certain aspect ratio, or orientation (think tablets being rotated). Media features consist of a key/value pair, much like a CSS rule, enclosed in parenthesis.
```
@media all and (orientation: portrait) {
  .column {
    width: 8.333%;
  }
}
```
There are many features you can query. Here are some of the most common:

* `display-mode: fullscreen` to see if the page is currently in fullscreen mode
* `orientation: <portrait|landscape>` to see if the page is currently in portrait or landscape orientation; this can be used for mobile devices, but is often less reliable than width and height features
* `min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height`, `max-height` to see what the current document dimensions are; this is probably the most common type of query used in responsive layout.

### An Example From Bootstrap

[Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is a popular front-end framework found sites all across the web. While we don't have time to dig in on the details of the whole framework, we'll borrow a simple set of media queries from Bootstrap version 3.3.7. Observe these "mobile first" media queries:
```
/* Extra small devices (phones, less than 768px) */
/* No media query since this is the default in Bootstrap */

/* Small devices (tablets, 768px and up) */
@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

/* Medium devices (desktops, 992px and up) */
@media (min-width: 992px) { ... }

/* Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }
```
Let's put these into practice and create a simple page where the `font-size` increases as the width of the page grows. You'll need to use the fullscreen option on the following code sample and resize your browser window to see the changes.
```
/* Extra small devices (phones, less than 768px) */
/* No media query since this is the default */
h1 {
  font-size: 14px;
}

/* Small devices (tablets, 768px and up) */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
}

/* Medium devices (desktops, 992px and up) */
@media (min-width: 992px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 36px;
  }
}

/* Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 48px;
  }
}
```
