## Lesson 1 Assignment

### Description

One of the basic, foundational skills of a professional web developer is the ability to translate a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS. This is what you will be doing over the course of 6 evenings.

This is the assignment for day 1.

### Details

Starting with this **<a href="./images/day-1-mockup.jpg" target="_blank">mockup</a>**, create the HTML and CSS for the following:

1. The site header
2. The product image area
3. The product pricing and description area
4. The footer

We haven't covered layout yet or how to move elements around, so for now just focus on writing the HTML for each area and adding some basic styles to it.

### Deliverables

1. Create a new project directory
2. Push your work to GitHub
3. Post the link to your GitHub project directory in Slack
