## Lesson 1 Assignment

### Description

The ability to translate a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS is a basic, foundational skill of a professional web developer. This is what you will do over the course of 6 evenings.

### Details

Use this **<a href="./images/day-1-mockup.jpg" target="_blank">mockup</a>** and create the HTML and CSS for the following:

1. The site header
2. The product image area
3. The product pricing and description area
