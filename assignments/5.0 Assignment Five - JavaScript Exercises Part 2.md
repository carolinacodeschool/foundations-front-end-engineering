## Lesson 5 Assignment

### Description

The ability to translate a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS is a basic, foundational skill of a professional web developer. This is what you will do over the course of 6 evenings.

Since the topics we covered in class today do not directly relate to the project you've been working on, tonight your homework will look a little different.

### Details

Today, you will work through some JavaScript exercises to help drive home the concepts of functions. Feel free to use **[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** for any help as you work through these exercises.

Download the **[exercises.js](./js/exercises.js)** file and add it to your project. Complete each exercise - there are 4 - and use the browser's console to check your work.
