## Lesson 3 Assignment

### Description

The ability to translate a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS is a basic, foundational skill of a professional web developer.

### Details

Use the **<a href="./images/day-1-mockup.jpg" target="_blank">mockup</a>** you were given on day 1 and position the elements on the page. Apply CSS layout techniques covered in class and focus on moving elements into the correct position.

You shouldn't have to write much HTML tonight, but you may refactor your code if if makes sense to do so.
