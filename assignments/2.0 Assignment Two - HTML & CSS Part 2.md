## Lesson 2 Assignment

### Description

One of the basic, foundational skills of a professional web developer is the ability to translate a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS. This is what you will be doing over the course of 6 evenings.

### Details

Use the **<a href="./images/day-1-mockup.jpg" target="_blank">mockup</a>** you were given on day 1 to create the HTML and CSS for the following:

* Tabbed content area
* Related product area

We still haven't covered layout yet or how to move elements around, so for now just focus on writing the HTML for each area and adding some basic styles.

### Deliverables

* Push your work to GitHub
