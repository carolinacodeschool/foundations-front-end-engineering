## Lesson 2 Assignment

### Description

The ability to translate a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS is a basic, foundational skill of a professional web developer. This is what you will do over the course of 6 evenings.

### Details

Use the **<a href="./images/day-1-mockup.jpg" target="_blank">mockup</a>** you were given on day 1 to create the HTML and CSS for the following:

* Tabbed content area
* Related product area

We still haven't covered layout yet or how to move elements around, so for now just focus on writing the HTML for each area and adding some basic styles.
