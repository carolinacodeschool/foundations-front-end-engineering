## Lesson 4 Assignment

### Description

The ability to translate a designer's mockup image into a webpage with HTML and CSS is a basic, foundational skill of a professional web developer. This is what you will do over the course of 6 evenings.

### Details

First, take some time to browse through **[MDN's JavaScript Section](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)**. It can be hard to read through at first, but try to at least begin to familiarize yourself with it. This will likely become one of the most powerful resources in the future as you continue to dive deeper into web development.

Second, go back through the exercises you worked on in class and see if you can replicate them without the help of your instructor.

Third, continue to use the **[mockup](./images/day-1-mockup.jpg)** you were given on day one, and fill in any gaps in your HTML or CSS that you may have previously missed.
